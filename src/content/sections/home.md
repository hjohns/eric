This project centres on Eric Johns’ new book, A History of Papua New Guinea from
Prehistory to Independence — a comprehensive, readable account designed for students,
educators and general readers. It draws on archives, photographs, maps and oral histories to
tell PNG’s story with clarity and respect.

### Why this matters

- **Comprehensive scholarship:** Completed in 2024, spanning prehistory to independence.
- **Built for educators:** Continues the tradition of <em>PNG History Through Stories</em> and <em>Famous People of PNG</em> used in classrooms.
- **Collaborative effort:** Publisher Chris Roering coordinated production and funded an initial short run so reviewers and partners could see the finished work.
