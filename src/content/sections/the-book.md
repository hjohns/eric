## A Comprehensive History for Papua New Guinea

*A History of Papua New Guinea from Prehistory to Independence* distils nearly two decades
of research into 635 pages that trace the nation’s story up to independence in 1975. Written by long-time educator and historian Eric Johns and privately published by Chris Roering in 2025, the book is already recognised by PNG academics and teachers as a vital resource for classrooms and libraries.

## The Author: Eric Johns

Eric Johns taught in Papua New Guinea high schools and at the Port Moresby Teachers College from 1960 to 1972 before returning to Canberra, where he continued to write extensively about PNG history. His earlier publications include the *Famous People of PNG* series and the two-volume *PNG History Through Stories*—both still recommended in the PNG education syllabus. Over the years his work has become a touchstone for educators seeking accurate, accessible accounts of the country's past.

## A Publishing Partnership Years in the Making

Eric began drafting this history in 2006 while staying in close contact with Chris Roering, a veteran publisher whose career spans Oxford University Press and Pearson Education. Even after Pearson stepped back from funding PNG titles, Chris encouraged Eric to keep writing and pledged to help bring the manuscript to life.

Their goal was to launch the book in time for PNG's 50th independence celebrations. Funding proposals were sent to publishers, businesses, embassies, and grant programs. Despite strong testimonials, the responses were mostly silent or negative. One bright moment came when the Australian High Commission in PNG considered supporting the project, but the request was ultimately declined because it did not originate from PNG government officials.

## Self-Funded to Reach the Finish Line

Undeterred, Chris personally financed professional editing, design, and a limited print run. Only 50 copies were produced at significant cost per copy, leaving a small number for Eric to share with academics, reviewers, and close supporters. These early readers are helping to build momentum for a broader release, yet there is still no stock available for sale.

## Call for Support

With the first edition complete, Eric and Chris are again seeking funding to place the book in PNG high schools, universities, and cultural institutions, and to make future printings affordable for readers in both PNG and Australia. If you'd like to help this foundational history reach the people it was written for, please get in touch.

> "Naturally I consider myself very fortunate. I still find it hard to believe that Chris would do this for me, but he told me his faith in the book was such that he is honoured to be associated with it." — Eric Johns, 18 September 2025
